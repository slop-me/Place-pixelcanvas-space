# Community Guidelines
1. No NSFL or NSFW images. Do not share or post graphic images for sadistic pleasure, glorification, or celebration of violence. Place 2.0 is targeted at many age ranges and people who may not want to see that.

2. We have always been a welcoming, respectful and safe community. As there is no age limit to the users, NSFW art is prohibited. This includes depictions of genitalia, nipples, sexual content and promotion of sexual sites. This extends to links, QR codes, or any other references to content outside of the canvas as well.

3. No offensive symbols or depictions. This includes any symbols relating to terrorism, racism, sexism, the promotion of self-harm or suicide, or ones intended to offend others. Examples of this include swastikas, hammer and sickle, the confederate flag, and any terrorist symbols.

4. No targeted harassment. Please respect every player. Do not threaten to harm another person or someone related to another person in any capacity, and do not make art depicting others in a negative or harassing manner.

5. No derogatory words, phrases, or sentences. This includes excessive slurs, racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, and malicious text. In essence, don't create anything that discriminates or harasses a person or group.

6. Do not use bots. The aim of Place 2.0 is a social game where everyone can hang out and create cool art. We have anti-botting measures in place, so do not try and circumvent them.

7. Do not make alternate accounts. We limit all players to a single account to ensure fairness for everyone accross the board. If we see you using more than one account, we will take the appropriate actions to stop this and further sign ups.

8. Do not make accounts solely to grief. If you are not going to contribute anything other than trashing art, then you're not welcome here. This specifically includes void and void-like entities that destroy existing art.

9. As previously discussed in #announcements, due to attacks on our website by other Place clones, the discussion of them is strictly prohibited.

10. Don't spam the chat with useless text or multiple messages that could have been sent in one. This may result in a ban.
